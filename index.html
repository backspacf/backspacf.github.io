<div id="title">bookmarklets: the coolest thing, ever (sep 18, 2019)</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so i own a chromebook. i didn't buy it myself (i would never do something that stupid), it's a school tool that they provided for free. because it's a free school-provided thing, it's bombarded with absolutely useless things and internet filters. though i know a fairly simple way around their filters, it's not like it works perfectly.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">point is, i need a way to do things i enjoy on this weird filtered chromebook. and the best way to do that is with bookmarklets.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">remember how i mentioned the way around the filter system? yeah, that used bookmarklets. lots of games have been written via bookmarklet, such as this game of <a href='javascript:Q=124;m=b=Q*Q;a=[P=l=u=d=p=S=w=0];u=89;f=(h=j=t=(b+Q)/2)-1;(B=(D=document).body).appendChild(x=D.createElement("p"));(X=x.style).position="fixed";X.left=X.top=0;X.background="#FFF";x.innerHTML="<p></p><canvas>";v=(s=x.childNodes)[0];(s=s[1]).width=s.height=5*Q;c=s.getContext("2d"); onkeydown=onblur=F=function(e,g){g?a[f]?(w+=m,f=Math.random(l+=8)*(R=Q-2)*R|(u=0),F(f+=Q+1+2*(f/R|0),g)):F(f):0>e?(l?--l:(y=t,t=a[t]-2,F(y)),S+=(w*=0.8)/4,m=999/(u++ +10),a[h+=[-1,-Q,1,Q][d=p]]?B.removeChild(x,alert("Game Over")):(F(h),F(e,j=h),v.innerHTML=P?(setTimeout(F,50,e,0),S|0):"Press P - Best: 648")):-e?(y=(a[e]=e<Q|e>=Q*Q-Q|!(e%Q)|e%Q==Q-1|2*(e==h))+(e==f),e==h&&(a[j]=2+h),c.fillStyle="hsl("+99*!a[e]+","+2*m+"%,"+50*y+"%)",c.fillRect(e%Q*5,5*(e/Q|0),5,5)):isNaN(y=e.keyCode-37)|43==y?(P=y&&!P)&&F(-1): p=!P|y&-4|!(y^2^d)?p:y;return!1};for(;--b;F(b));void F(-1);'>snake</a>. bookmarklets can activate up to 2000 characters of javascript at a time. but you can break that limit with a bookmarklet such as:</div>
<code id="codeBlock">javascript:s=document.body.appendChild(document.createElement
('script'));s.id='fs';s.language='javascript';void
(s.src='https://example.com/over2000charsJStext.js');</code>
<div id="avgTextBlock">using this, you can have basically limitless power with your bookmarklet. as i'm sure you know, they <i>do</i> directly affect the webpage. this means that they can also be used as "hacks" on server-based games. for example, you can easily hack cookie clicker by making the bookmarklet console.log information that gives you extra stuff. but more importantly, because the game uses cloud saves from <i>your</i> server, it will actually stay on the page upon reload.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so obviously bookmarklets are epic. but now that i've mentioned them, i'm sure you want to see some. so i've compiled my favorite bookmarklets <a href="bookmarkletList.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

<div id="title">minecraft console edition's horrible dlc protection, and some really cool custom skin compatibility that was unintended (oct 20, 2019)</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so i've been messing around in my ps3's files. i've grown to respect multiman's file manager. i didn't realize how easy it was to pick up and get to using fairly well.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so i found minecraft's file (/dev_hdd0/game/npub31419 for me) and extremely quickly found the dlc folder. inside was <i>every single dlc</i> in the game, as well as a folder labeled "trialupgrade" with a file labeled "key.bin.edat." i quickly discovered that i could <i>literally copy and paste the same key</i> that was already in the game files into any dlc i wanted to unlock it. considering the fact that backing up your entire ps3's files is extremely easy even on ofw, this security is literal trash.
</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so apparently, all you have to do to unlock any dlc you want is to copy-paste a key already within the files into the designated folder. no checks, nothing. just key.bin.edat.
</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">but it goes further than that. a really cool guy named jack at <a href="http://www.nobledez.com/#home" target="_blank">nobledez.com</a> made a tool called "pck studio" (originally "minekampf," likely referencing that book made by hitler) which allows you to import custom skins into the game. not only that, but they work flawlessly online. <i>including</i> the custom models.
</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">that's right. you can import custom models into the game and it will work online. one of my favorites are the two-times sized models, which are fun to screw around with people with. my main use is to get back the herobrine skin (which was removed for unknown reasons a while back) and to get a fully invisible skin.
</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">so the possibilities are endless with this stuff. go and make something cool. it's sad that nobody really made this bigger -- the only legacy console it didn't work on without jailbreak was xbox.
</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">anyways, i think that's pretty cool. have fun out there, fellow mediocre programmers.
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div id="title">so it begins... (sep 16, 2019)</div>
<br>
<div id="avgTextBlock">welcome to my website. this is my first ever blog post. i should probably catch you up on everything.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">to clear things up: i am not very good at programming. this website is based around my programming. thus, everything you take here should be considered with half a grain of salt. i know near to nothing about javascript and not much about html. and thats all i know.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">also, this is hosted without a website builder of any sort. this is entirely my html on this website, so bear with any horrible programming here. not only that, but im really bad at being clean in my programming. don't believe me? check the source code of this webpage. im super messy, believe me.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">one more thing for now: this website will likely be static forever. i have no idea how to make it flow well or anything. i just like to code.</div>
<div id="avgTextBlock">thats it for now. have a good time, random user</div>
