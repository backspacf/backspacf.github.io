/*
bigHTM.js by joj-the-egg.
this is a javascript library built to increase ability of html by adding features.
to use:

 - if your file is .html (which is recommended), make sure to add a <!DOCTYPE html>.
   then add a <script> tag from beginning to end (excluding DOCTYPE). write your html within the script. make sure your script tag has the id "bigHTM".
   write your js within the script as well.
   also outside of the main script tag, add another script tag to include bigHTM (recommended to use my link: //backspacf.github.io/js/bigHTM.js):
   <script src="(bigHTM source)"></script>
 - if your file is .js (which is not recommended unless you know what you are doing), simply write your brand-new htm code.
   full documentation here: https://backspacf.github.io/bigHTM/docs.html

have fun, and don't die. visit me at https://backspacf.github.io

    ALPHA-0.01. all this is is a thing that writes all hyper-text markup out of the script tag. more to come.

(function(){
  document.write(document.getElementById(bigHTM).value);
  //writes all htm in this script tag.
});
